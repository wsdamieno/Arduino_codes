BUZZER

  Use the buzzer to play a song!

/*
This sketch uses the buzzer to play songs.
The Arduino's tone() command will play notes of a given frequency.
We'll provide a function that takes in note characters (a-g),
and returns the corresponding frequency from this table:

  note  frequency
  c     262 Hz
  d     294 Hz
  e     330 Hz
  f     349 Hz
  g     392 Hz
  a     440 Hz
  b     494 Hz
  C     523 Hz

// in your song. A space represents a rest (no tone)

// A "1" represents a quarter-note, 2 a half-note, etc.
